# Sunday-algorithm
Project that I made for my algorithm class.

Implementing Sunday Algorithm with JavaScript.

Sunday Algorithm is used for searching pattern in text.

SundayAlg.js generates random text and random pattern with alphabet given by user. Then with these random data it tries to find pattern and also it is counting operations done while searching.
